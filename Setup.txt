I have windows in my only computer so its tricky to get a bash to run it all in a linux computer

Im missing details from Phase 2: Tag application and filtering, i can add tags and filter by name to show the notes with that tag,
but im missing the delete and showing of the tags on each note. im guessing its due to a bad configuration on vue on my part
but im limited to one page and can't use modals thats the why of the prompts.

Any doubt about the code or the installation my personal email is: everha20@hotmail.com
